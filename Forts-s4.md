At this point it should be done already, but if you need to send in dogs, you probably lost, and best to send them out as soon as you can

*10 cost* -> Epic dog x2 **Front slot**

At this point it was done. **BUT**, if for any reason this was not enough, you should still have a necro, lego flyers, and rare dogs. Try to slip in between ults with lego flyers to take out another DPS, and then go for a necro + dog swarm I guess

⚠️Evaluate carefully here, the safest option is probably to go with healer first, but fighter stack can work if your Maw is high enough BP. Maybe 2 healers is better instead of one and then axe. ⚠️

*3 cost* -> Healer **Front slot**

*6 cost* -> Axe men **Front slot**

*3 cost* -> Healer **Front slot**

⚠️If coast is almost clear, send in dogs, otherwise you may want to send in axe men first, and rush dogs as soon as you can ⚠️

Epic flyers first, lego second, the rest legitimately doesn't matter. C.f the above Khamet/Arro defence

## Timings

*10 cost* -> Mage Tank **Back slot**

🕐The exact time of the line below varies, you want the lego flyers to arrive after all the ults, lego flyers take roughly 30 seconds to arrive from the middle slot

*2:13 left* -> Lego Flyer x2 **Middle slot**

*10 cost* -> Dagger girlsx2 **Front slot**

❔ Kind of depends on who is alive, epic flyers worked for me here, but if it's a different mage than Ajax, units other than epic flyers might be the better option.

# Random stuff

<summary><h2>Generic Entrance stacks </h2></summary>

⚠️This is one that is somewhat BP dependant, it can work great, just as it can fail if used in the wrong situation. Use on teams that will become terrible once the ults start popping, but avoid on teams with a BP that is too high compared to yours ⚠️

**I would only ever recommend using this one if you are confident in what you are doing, and have tested it in a few friendly faceoffs to understand the general idea** 

## Team Layout

![image](https://github.com/Pink-Peanuts/wor-stuff/assets/144652551/60ec1a3a-f291-4fbd-9508-fcf6d0f8f931)

Last two aren't that important, and can be swapped around based on what you need after the first tank/passive/ult has been forced.

## Timings

*IN THE FIRST HALF SECOND OF THE GAME* -> Rare fighter x2 **Front slot**

⚠️**Seriously, the second the game starts, you should be spamming to pause the game, get your mouse ready to hover a unit, unpause, immediately click on the unit, and drop a double stack of these fighters before the cost can even get to 7 1/4. THE ENTIRE PREMISE hinges on them reaching and killing the tank before the ults start raining down ⚠️

⚠️The timings here are more indicative than anything else. You need to apply some judgement here for the rest. Is a silas ult still up and it will hit your melees? Tempo a bit. Is praetus ult up soon? Tempo a bit. Stuff like that. This can't be exactly defined, unless I start listing them all, and for this strat I don't think it's worth it to do that. ⚠️

*9 cost* -> Dagger girls **Front slot**

*6 cost* -> Axe men **Front slot**

At this point, you should be past the first tank, or burned enough of their passives/ults/revives that you're in the clear.

Either send in another fighter stack if you need that tank dead, or mages to clear up a clumped formation, or flyers to get over and kill the backline valk before next ult... Honestly at this point the world is your oyster, and you should be in the clear.
