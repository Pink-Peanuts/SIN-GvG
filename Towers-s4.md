2 slots are free here, up to you to see what would work best as plan B should this fail.

## Timings

*10 cost* -> Rare tanks **Back** (This is ult bait)

:warning: **Rare tanks take 25 seconds to get from back slot, to the start of the farthest tile a piercer boosted marksman can reach, time around ults accordingly, to know when to start the rest of the strategy** :warning:
